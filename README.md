# Cube Timer

## Introduction

Cube Timer is a browser-based timer for speedcubers to record solve times and perform analysis. Upon completion, it will automatically compute and display live averages and distributions. The project was started in January 2018 and is currently undergoing rapid development. It will also likely be renamed.

## Current Features
* Scrambles several different puzzle types
* Records solves times
* Saves solve times for current browser session
* Displays the following sessions stats:
  * Overall:
    * Mean
    * Average
    * Standard Deviation
  * Current and best:
    * Single
    * Mean of 3
    * Average of 5
    * Average of 12
    * Average of 50
    * Average of 100
  * For each solve:
    * Single
    * Mean of 3
    * Average of 5
    * Average of 12

## Future Features
- Save solve times for future viewing
- Implement creating and switching sessions
- Display lifetime stats
- Display distribution graphs for current session and lifetime
